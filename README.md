# 3D-Knot

Tinkering with generating images of a mathematical knot in 3-dimensions using Python3. This is a work in progress.

**Update:** Well, I found a way to draw what I wanted in [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ddfa4a1931ebecc3c444a07b/w/f21d5729ade25bddb7c5047c/e/b7ec90854dcc02ac797f72ab), so this Python project is abandoned for now.
